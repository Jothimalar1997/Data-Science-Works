    "(i) Database is an organised collection of structured information that is stored electronically in computer which can be easily accessed and managed.\n",
    "(ii) It is controlled by Database Management System(DBMS).\n",
    "(iii) The main purpose of database is to operate large amount of information by storing,retreiving and managing data.\n",
    "### Difference between sql and nosql:\n",
    "(i) sql database is also called as relational database, nosql is called as non-relational or distributed database.\n",
    "(ii) sql db has pre-defined or fixed schema, nosql has dynamic schema.\n",
    "(iii) sql db is not suited for hierarchial data storage, nosql db is best suited for hierarchial data storage.\n",
    "(iv) sql db is suited for complex queries, nosql db is not suited for complex queries.\n",
