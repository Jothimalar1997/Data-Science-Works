        "1) Connectivity-based Clustering (Hierarchical clustering): This approach is based on the connectivity between data points. It can be further divided into two types: Agglomerative (bottom-up) and Divisive (top-down) clustering1.\n",
        "2) Centroids-based Clustering (Partitioning methods): This approach is based on the distance between data points and cluster centroids. It can be further divided into two types: K-means and K-medoids1.\n",
        "3) Density-based Clustering (Model-based Methods): This approach is based on the density of data points in a given area. It can be further divided into two types: DBSCAN and OPTICS1.\n",
        "4) Distribution-based Clustering: This approach is based on the probability distribution of data points. It can be further divided into two types: Gaussian Mixture Models (GMM) and Expectation-Maximization (EM)2.\n",
